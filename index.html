                    exploring data. In my work at the Federal Senate of Brazil, I research a variety of topics 
                    to inform legislative proposals. I believe evidence-based public policy is the key to 
                    shape a better society. To get relevant insights for my work, I analyse data in R and 
                    Python. During my master, I worked at the Hertie School Data Science Lab, 
                    in Berlin. As a teaching assistant I offered consultations on R, data visualization 
                    and causal inference. In my free time, apart from exploring data, I like exploring 
                    new places and cultures. Reading, gaming, history and jogging are also my hobbies. 
                    In this page I present some of my projects and experiences. See more below.</p>

                        <p> In 2007, a series of reforms were implemented in the education system in
                            Ceará, Brazil. This research aims to explore data on the education quality index
                            to find out if it suggests these reforms had an impact on student achievement.
                            In order to do so, panel data is analysed through spatial plots, time series and
                            scatter plots.<br><a class = "view-more" href="2020/06/30/education.html" target="_blank">View more</a></p>

                            Traxler. Two causal inference methodologies - fixed-effects and synthetic control method - were employed
                            to examine the effect of the educational reforms implemented in Ceará, Brazil.</p>

                        <p>This project was presented in the Machine Learning Course at the Hertie School in 2021, tutored by
                            Professor Slava Jankin and Hannah Bechara. Our goal was to employ machine learning algorithms to predict
                            loan default probabilities in the context of a Brazilian student loan program called FIES. For the
                            initial runs, we employed 5 methods: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, linear support
                            vector classification, and artificial neural networks - ANN. Random forest and ANN achieved the highest
                            area under the curve (AUC) scores. Our final objective was to create an ensemble model with the best
                            performing models. Moreover we studied the predictive power of the main features. We also discussed the
                            ethical, social, and economic implications of the results obtained. <br>
