          <h1>Welcome,</h1>
          <p>I'm Bruno, a legislative advisor working at the Federal Senate of Brazil. I reasearch a variety of topics to inform legislative proposals. My main interest is evidence-based public policy, especially in the field of education. During my master I worked at the Hertie School Data Science Lab, in Berlin. As a teaching assistant I offered consultations on R, data visualization and causal inference to other students at Hertie. In my free time, apart from exploring data, I like exploring new places and cultures. Reading, gamming and jogging are also my hobbies. In this page I present some of my projects and experiences. I hope you like.</p>        </div>

            <p>  In 2007, a series of reforms were implemented in the education system in
              Ceará, Brazil. This research aims to explore data on the education quality index
              to find out if it suggests these reforms had an impact on student achievement.
              In order to do so, panel data is analysed through spatial plots, time series and
              scatter plots.</p>

            <p> This project is a continuation of the exploratory analysis of the educational reforms in Ceará. It was actually my Master thesis presented at the Hertie School in 2021 and tutored by Professor Christian Traxler. Two causal inference methodologies - fixed-effects and synthetic control method - were employed to examine the effect of the educational reforms implemented in Ceará, Brazil.</p>

            <p>This project was presented in the Machine Learning Course at the Hertie School in 2021, tutored by Professor Slava Jankin and Hannah Bechara. Our goal was to employ machine learning algorithms to predict loan default probabilities in the context of a Brazilian student loan program called FIES. For the initial runs, we employed 5 methods: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, linear support vector classification, and artificial neural networks - ANN. Random forest and ANN achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) scores. Our final objective was to create an ensemble model with the best performing models. Moreover we studied the predictive power of the main features. We also  discussed the ethical, social, and economic implications of the results obtained.</p>

          <h1>Current Work</h1><br>
          <p> Currently I have been investigating data on schooling quality in the state of Sergipe, Brazil.</p><br>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
              <p>To identify the main weaknesses of education in Sergipe and propose recommendations.</p><br>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
              <p>Analysing data provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and researching the related literature.</p><br>
            <h3>Outlook</h3>
              <p> So far, the main findings are:</p>
                <ul class = whitePar>
                  <li>the index of education quality in Sergipe is low compared to other states;</li>
                  <li>severe lack of training for teachers;</li>
                  <li>poor infrastructure (libraries and labs);</li>
                  <li>insufficient textbooks;</li>
                </ul>
              <p> The plot bellow compares Sergipe and Brazil's distribution of the index of education quality. It is clearly visible that Sergipe has lower performance compared to the rest of the country.</p>

              <p> To further explore the outcomes of Sergipe relative to the other states, I employed the following bar plot: </p>
