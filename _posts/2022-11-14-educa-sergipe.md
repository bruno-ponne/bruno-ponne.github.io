abstract: A dashboard created in R Shiny to monitor and analyze educational data of municipalities in Sergipe, Brazil. The aim of this platform is to provide quality data and analyses to guide mayors in their local educational policies. It was developed as part of my work at the Federal Senate of Brazil during 2022.
