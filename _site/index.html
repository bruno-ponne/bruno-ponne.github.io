                            This project was presented in the Machine Learning Course at the Hertie School in 2021, tutored by Professor Slava Jankin and Hannah Bechara. It was developed in partnership with two other students*. Our goal was to employ machine learning algorithms to predict loan default probabilities in the context of a Brazilian student loan program called FIES. We employed 5 methods: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, linear support vector classification, artificial neural networks - ANN, and an ensemble model. The ensemble model achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) scores. We also discussed the ethical, social, and economic implications of the results obtained.

                            In 2007, a series of reforms were implemented in the education system in Ceará, Brazil. This research aims to explore data on the education quality index to find out if it suggests these reforms had an impact on student achievement. In order to do so, panel data is analyzed through spatial plots, time series and scatter plots.
