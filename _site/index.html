                    <p><p class = "hello-highlight"> Hello! I'm Bruno, </p> a legislative advisor who loves 
                    exploring data. In my work at the Federal Senate of Brazil, I research a variety of topics 
                    to inform legislative proposals. I believe evidence-based public policy is the key to 
                    shape a better society. To get relevant insights for my work, I analyse data in R and 
                    Python. During my master, I worked at the Hertie School Data Science Lab, 
                    in Berlin. As a teaching assistant I offered consultations on R, data visualization 
                    and causal inference. In my free time, apart from exploring data, I like exploring 
                    new places and cultures. Reading, gaming, history and jogging are also my hobbies. 
                    In this page I present some of my projects and experiences. See more below.</p>

                            A dashboard created in R Shiny to monitor and analyse educational data of municipalities in Sergipe, Brazil. The aim of this platform is to provide quality data and analyses to guide mayors in their local educational policies. It was developed as part of my work at the Federal Senate of Brazil during 2022.

                                Predicting student loan default in Brazil</a>
                            </h2>
                            This project was presented in the Machine Learning Course at the Hertie School in 2021, tutored by Professor Slava Jankin and Hannah Bechara. It was developed in partnership with two other students*. Our goal was to employ machine learning algorithms to predict loan default probabilities in the context of a Brazilian student loan program called FIES. We employed 5 methods: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, linear support vector classification, artificial neural networks - ANN, and an ensemble model. The ensemble model achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) scores. We also discussed the ethical, social, and economic implications of the results obtained.

                            In 2007, a series of reforms were implemented in the education system in Ceará, Brazil. This research aims to explore data on the education quality index to find out if it suggests these reforms had an impact on student achievement. In order to do so, panel data is analysed through spatial plots, time series and scatter plots.
