                    As a data analyst at The Data School in Hamburg, I am passionate about data analysis as a tool to inform important decisions. 
                    I am a firm believer in evidence-based decision-making and see it as a primary factor for business success. 
                    Before joining The Data School, I was a legislative advisor at the Federal Senate of Brazil, where I advocated for data-driven policy-making. 
                    To gain relevant insights for my work, I analyze data using Tableau, Power BI, Alteryx, R, and Python.

                    During my master's degree, I had the privilege of working at the Hertie School Data Science Lab in Berlin. 
                    In my role as a teaching assistant, I provided consultations on R, data visualization, and causal inference, further deepening my understanding and skill set in these areas.

                    In 2023, I published my Master thesis <a href="https://doi.org/10.1590/1981-3821202300010005" target="_blank"> Better Incentives, Better Marks: A Synthetic Control Evaluation of the Educational Policies in Ceará, Brazil.</a>

                                Predicting student loan default in Brazil</a>
                            </h2>
                            This project was presented in the Machine Learning Course at the Hertie School in 2021, tutored by Professor Slava Jankin and Hannah Bechara. It was developed in partnership with two other students*. Our goal was to employ machine learning algorithms to predict loan default probabilities in the context of a Brazilian student loan program called FIES. We employed 5 methods: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, linear support vector classification, artificial neural networks - ANN, and an ensemble model. The ensemble model achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) scores. We also discussed the ethical, social, and economic implications of the results obtained.

                            In 2007, a series of reforms were implemented in the education system in Ceará, Brazil. This research aims to explore data on the education quality index to find out if it suggests these reforms had an impact on student achievement. In order to do so, panel data is analyzed through spatial plots, time series and scatter plots.
